## PASSWORD MANAGER

This is a simple Python program that generates secure passwords with customized lengths. It's a handy tool to help you create strong and unique passwords for your online accounts.

### How it Works

1. User Input: The program begins by asking you to enter the desired length for your password. You can specify how long you want your password to be.

2. **Character Selection**: The password generator selects characters from four categories to ensure password strength:
Uppercase letters (A–Z)
Lowercase letters (a–z)
Numbers (0–9)
Special characters ("#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~)

3. **Generation Process**: It generates the password based on the characters you selected. The password includes at least one character from each category.

4. **Shuffling**: To enhance security, the program shuffles the characters in the password, making it even harder to predict.

### Important Note

It's important to specify a length of at least 4 characters to ensure the generated password is meaningful and secure.
Strong and unique passwords are crucial for safeguarding your online accounts.

Feel free to use and modify this code for your own projects or share it with others who may find it useful for improving their online security.

Give it a try and enhance your online safety with strong, randomly generated passwords!
